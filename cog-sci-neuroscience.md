## Why We Study The Brain

The concept here is the importance of studying the brain to understand neurological disorders and develop effective treatments. 

By studying the brain, researchers can gain insights into how it functions, how different regions interact, and how disruptions in brain activity can lead to various neurological conditions. 

This knowledge is crucial for developing therapies, medications, and interventions to treat conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and mental health disorders.


## The Seductive Allure of Neuroscience Explanations
This section focuses on the concept of the "seductive allure" of neuroscience explanations. 

It refers to the tendency of people to perceive explanations as more valid or credible when they include references to brain scans or neuroscience terminology, even if the information provided is not directly relevant or informative. 

This phenomenon highlights the need for critical thinking and careful interpretation of neuroscience research to avoid oversimplification or misinterpretation of findings.

### The Experiment:

The concept explored in this section is the "curse of knowledge."

The curse of knowledge refers to the difficulty people have in imagining what it's like not to know something once they already know it. In the context of the experiment described, the participants who knew the secret details had a hard time understanding why others couldn't guess the answers correctly. 

This concept emphasizes the challenges in effectively communicating information to others when we possess knowledge that they lack.

## Neural Mechanism Underlying Cognition:

This section focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive functions, such as mental imagery. 

It explores how specific brain regions and processes contribute to cognitive processes, including perception, attention, memory, language, and decision-making. 

By studying the neural correlates of cognition, researchers can gain insights into how the brain enables various cognitive functions and potentially develop interventions for cognitive disorders.

Kinds of cognitive processes:

* Talking
* Being able to imagine things you have never seen (Ex: a shark with horse legs).
* Anything the human mind can do must be supported by the brain and how the brain can support the cognitive process and how the neuron correlates

### What Your Brain Does Not Tell You:

Brain activity or activation patterns alone do not provide a complete understanding of cognitive processes and may not necessarily be causally linked to experience or perception. 

While brain imaging techniques like fMRI can reveal correlations between brain activity and cognitive tasks, they do not provide a full explanation of the underlying mechanisms. Other factors, such as context, behavior, and subjective experiences, need to be considered to form a comprehensive understanding of cognition.

## Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI):

The concept explored in this section is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique used to measure and visualize brain activity.

fMRI detects changes in blood flow and oxygenation in different brain regions, providing insights into functional brain organization. 

By analyzing fMRI data, researchers can identify brain areas associated with specific cognitive tasks, investigate brain networks, and study how brain activity changes under different conditions or in response to interventions.

What does this technique tell us:
* This process is very slow.
* Must wait for the area for the O2 to be consumed and then for an inflow of oxygenated blood.
* Takes 10 - 12 seconds to see this inflow of oxygen to the region.
* This technique has a bad temporal resolution.
* fMRI is not a good technique to tell you when these regions are activated.

The benefits:
* fMRI has a very good spatial resolution.
* It tells us where things happened.
* Youâ€™re able to see where the blood is going with a high degree of specificity.

## Transcranial Magnetic Stimulations (TMS):

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), is a non-invasive technique that can temporarily disrupt or modulate brain activity. 

TMS involves applying magnetic fields to specific regions of the brain, which can either activate or inhibit neuronal activity in those areas. By using TMS, researchers can investigate the causal relationship between brain regions and behavior, study brain plasticity, and explore potential therapeutic applications for conditions like depression, chronic pain, and motor disorders.

## Electrophysiology:

Electrophysiology, specifically EEG, is a technique that measures the electrical activity of neurons by placing electrodes on a person's scalp, allowing us to observe the brain's real-time functioning.

EEG provides great temporal resolution as it captures the brain's electrical activity thousands of times per second. However, it has limited spatial resolution and cannot precisely determine the exact origin of brain activity. 

By measuring electrical potentials, specifically postsynaptic potentials generated by groups of neurons in the outer layer of the cortex, EEG helps us understand the processes occurring in the brain and the steps it takes to perform computations. 

Event-related potentials (ERPs) in EEG allow us to observe specific brain responses to particular processes, characterized by waveform features such as amplitude, latency, polarity, and scalp location.

### Brain Predicting Sound:
In the human brain, the process of predicting what will happen next, based on prior experience, can be measured using EEG. 

Prediction errors, when the brain fails to accurately predict the next sensory input, can be assessed through an ERP called Mismatch Negativity (MMN). The MMN is an automatic and attention-independent test that can even be used to evaluate the brain activity of comatose patients. 

The brain relies on categorical representations and uses category information to make predictions rather than focusing on individual stimuli. It encodes and represents continuous sounds by mapping them into discrete categories, highlighting how the brain forms mental representations and encodes sensory information.

### EEG Studies in Action:
In studies exploring speech perception, which involves perceiving distinct categories from a continuous spectrum of speech sounds, EEG has provided valuable insights. 

Researchers have found a correlation between the amplitude of brain responses measured by EEG and the physical description of the sound being heard. This correlation suggests that the brain encodes the analog nature of continuous sounds before converting them into discrete categories. 

Therefore, our auditory system continuously encodes continuous sounds and subsequently maps them to the discrete categories we recognize. This research enhances our understanding of how the brain forms mental representations and encodes sensory information.

## Implicit Learning Vs. Explicit Learning:

### Implicit Learning:
Implicit learning involves a cue-based, effortless, and unconscious process of acquiring knowledge. 

It occurs gradually without the need for explicit feedback and relies on learning from positive examples only. This type of learning may not be the most effective for engaging neural plasticity. In a study comparing implicit learners to explicit learners, distinct brain responses were observed.

### Explicit Learning:
Explicit learning, on the other hand, is rule-based and conscious. It requires effort and involves an abrupt learning process with explicit feedback. 

Explicit learners are exposed to both positive and negative examples during the learning process. However, explicit learning may not engage neural plasticity as effectively as implicit learning.

### Experimental Findings:
In an experiment that examined implicit and explicit learners, researchers found differences in brain responses associated with language processing. 

Implicit learners exhibited the LPC (Late Positive Component) brain response, which is associated with native language processing. Despite potentially low test accuracy, implicit learners internalized the rule and processed it similarly to rules in their native language.

In contrast, explicit learners showed a different brain response. When categorizing stimuli as good/bad or grammatical/ungrammatical, they exhibited the P300 brain response but did not show the LPC response associated with processing rules in their native language. 

This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that explicit learners were not explicitly taught the rule, leading to differences in how they categorize information.

### Conclusion:
Implicit learning enables the internalization and processing of rules similar to those in one's native language. In contrast, explicit learning may not evoke the same neural responses and may not engage neural plasticity as effectively. 

The findings highlight the distinct processes involved in implicit and explicit learning and their impact on the brain's processing of linguistic rules.
