## Sensation:

Sensation refers to the detection of physical stimuli through peripheral receptors, which convert them into electrical signals that can be transmitted to the brain. It involves the process of transduction, where physical stimuli are converted into electrical signals that the brain can interpret.

## Perception:

Perception involves the interpretation of sensory information to build a representation of the world.

It utilizes top-down processing, which uses models, ideas, and expectations to interpret sensory information, and bottom-up processing, which involves taking sensory information and assembling it into a coherent perception. 

Perception is a complex process influenced by factors such as assumptions, context, and individual differences.

Here is why perception is complex:

* A computer AI miss categorizes an image of a kid looking at drums as a kid looking at a panda.
* Adversarial images are images that are categorically miscategorized by neural networks (even really advanced vision networks).
* Connectionist networks and neural networks are more or less like a black box, so we don’t know what’s happening.
* We know though if something goes wrong at the output layer because you have a miscategorization the computer vision AI thinks it’s a giant panda.
* A lot of computation goes to human vision and it’s very difficult to
reproduce the process on a computer.


## Pathway of Visual Information:

Visual information from the eyes is transmitted to various areas of the brain.

The geniculostriate pathway is responsible for the conscious vision and processes visual information in the primary visual cortex. It separates and processes visual information from the right and left visual fields. 

The primary visual cortex, also known as V1, is responsible for transforming visual information into basic codes that can be further processed and interpreted.

## Perceptual System:

The perceptual system makes assumptions and fills in gaps in sensory information. 

It exhibits color constancy, perceiving consistent colors despite changes in lighting. The perceptual system also makes assumptions about continuity, depth, and object representations. Attention plays a crucial role in perception by directing focus and disambiguating sensory information.

### Perceptual System Assumption of Depth:
* It relates to something called size constancy scaling.
* The perceptual system is taking depth cues into account.
* The retina (layers of nerve tissues at the back of the eye that receives images) does not allow for much in terms of depth cues.
* The perceptual system is then trying to build in assumptions to see how far things are to scale them appropriately.
* It’s making things bigger or smaller depending on the distance of an object.

Perception relies on the attention of how you choose to focus your gaze or mental focus to build a representation of our world and attention helps to disambiguate and figure out what parts of a scene to pay attention to.

Attention seems to fundamentally change what perception processing looks like.


## Transduction:

Transduction is the process of converting physical stimuli into electrical signals that the brain can process. 

In the auditory modality, sound signals are transduced into electrical signals for auditory processing.

### Example of Transduction from auditory modality:
* Sound signals are converted into electrical signals.
* It has to convert changes in air pressure.
* Electrical signals then have to process into the brain.
* It allows us to build up conscious-level auditory representations of our
environment.
* It all starts with this conversion of the sound signal to the electrical signal.

## Visual Pathway:

The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is part of the thalamus and processes visual information from the eyes. 

It contains the following cells:

* Parvo cells (color details)
* Magno cells (movement)
* Konio cells (general). 

The LGN represents different parts of space and different parts of the retina. The information from the LGN is processed in the primary visual cortex (V1), which extracts basic information such as edges, orientations, and wavelengths of light. 

Different cell types in V1, including simple cells, complex cells, and hypercomplex cells, contribute to the processing of visual information.

## Modality of Vision:

![](/images/cog-sci-images/eye.png)

The pupil regulates the amount of light entering the eye, constricting in bright light and dilating in low light. 

The lens focuses light and can change its shape to accommodate different distances.

The retina contains photoreceptor cells, such as rods (better in the dark) and cones (better in light and color-sensitive). 

The fovea, located in the center of the retina, has the highest visual acuity and contains densely packed cones. 

The optic nerve transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.

## Photoreceptor Cells:

Rod cells are more sensitive to low light levels and do not distinguish colors, while cone cells are more responsive in well-lit conditions and are color-sensitive.

Cone cells are more responsive in bright light conditions and are responsible for color vision.

Rods and cones contain light-sensitive pigments that undergo chemical changes when exposed to light. These changes trigger electrical signals that are transmitted to other cells in the retina for further processing.

## Visual Processing in the Brain:

After the signals leave the retina, they travel through the optic nerve, which carries visual information to the brain. The optic nerve fibers from each eye partially cross over at the optic chiasm, resulting in the integration of information from both eyes.

From the optic chiasm, visual information is relayed to the thalamus, specifically the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The LGN acts as a gateway, processing and relaying visual information to the primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe.

V1 is responsible for the initial processing of visual information, such as detecting edges, orientations, and basic features. From V1, visual information is further processed in higher-level visual areas, such as the ventral and dorsal streams.

## Ventral and Dorsal Streams:

The Ventral Stream, also known as the "what" pathway, is involved in object recognition and identification. It processes visual information related to form, color, and object recognition, and extends to the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe contains areas like the fusiform face area (FFA) and the parahippocampal place area (PPA).

The FFA is specifically involved in face recognition, while the PPA is involved in scene recognition.

The Dorsal Stream, also known as the "where" or "how" pathway, is involved in spatial perception and guiding actions. It processes visual information related to motion, depth, and spatial awareness, and extends to the parietal lobe.

The parietal lobe contains areas like the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which integrates visual information with other sensory inputs to guide actions.

## Visual Illusions and Perceptual Biases:

Visual illusions are perceptual phenomena that occur when our brain misinterprets or misperceives visual information. Illusions can reveal underlying principles and biases in visual perception.

Examples of visual illusions include the Müller-Lyer illusion, where two lines with arrowheads appear to be of different lengths, and the Ponzo illusion, where two identical lines appear to be different due to the presence of converging lines.

Perceptual biases can also influence visual perception, such as the tendency to perceive familiar patterns or faces in random or ambiguous stimuli (pareidolia).

## Conclusion:

Overall, vision involves the complex interplay between sensation, perception, and the processing of visual information in the brain. The visual system's intricate pathways and mechanisms allow us to perceive the world around us, recognize objects and faces, navigate our environment, and make sense of the visual stimuli we encounter.
