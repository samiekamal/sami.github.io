## Background
Smaglantis is an open world action/rpg game currently being developed in the Godot Game Engine. Currently, it is in a prototype phase, but has the potential to be a full-fledged game.

## Character Creator Menu

Developed a prototype character creator menu before the game starts and plan to add more customization options and a female protagonist option. It was very time-consuming to create due to having to animate the player's body and then drawing every different combination of hair styles,pants, etc.

## Gameplay

A basic forest world has been designed along with bat enemies. I recently created an inventory system to change different clothing and to equip weapons. I plan to add more inventory functionality. I plan to add more weapons and introduce magic abilites to do some cool animation attacks.
