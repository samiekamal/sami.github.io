# What is Cognitive Science?
Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of psychology, philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and anthropology. 

It seeks to understand the nature of cognition, including processes such as perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning, and problem-solving. By integrating knowledge from different disciplines, cognitive science aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mind and its underlying mechanisms.

## Computer Metaphor
The computer metaphor suggests that the mind functions similarly to a computer. It posits that the brain has a computational structure that processes information. 

This metaphor breaks down mental processes into distinct stages: 
* Perception (input)
* Thought (processing)
* Memory (storage)
* Behavior (output)

It implies that the mind operates through the manipulation of symbols or representations, much like a computer processes data. However, it is important to note that this metaphor is a simplification and does not capture the full complexity of the human mind.

## Multiple Realizability of Pain:
Multiple realizability refers to the idea that a particular mental state, such as pain, can be instantiated by different physical systems. 

In the case of pain, it means that diverse entities, such as humans, octopuses, or even artificial intelligence systems, can experience pain despite having different underlying physical structures. 

Pain is determined by similar stimuli and experiences that result in comparable behavioral responses, rather than by a specific underlying physical state. Each system may experience pain in its unique way, but they share common characteristics that fulfill the functional profile of pain.

## The Multiple Realizability Thesis:

The multiple realizability thesis states that all mental kinds can be instantiated by distinct physical kinds. 

It argues that if a given mental kind can be realized by different physical kinds, then it cannot be identical to any specific physical kind. In other words, mental states are not reducible to specific physical states but can be realized by a range of physical systems with different underlying structures.

## Functionalism:

Functionalism is a theory in the philosophy of mind that posits mental states are defined by their function within a cognitive system. 

It asserts that what makes something a thought, desire, pain, or any other mental state is not its physical constitution but rather its role or function in the system. Mental states are considered multiply realizable, meaning they can be realized by different types of physical substances. 

Functionalism emphasizes the shared functional profile across different systems that enable us to classify them as belonging to a specific class of mental states, such as pain. This approach highlights the importance of the functional characteristics of mental states rather than the specific physical states.

## Mental Representations:
Mental representations are the building blocks of the mind. They are cognitive structures that allow us to represent objects, situations, and abstract ideas. 

Mental representations enable us to reason, plan, remember, communicate, and engage in various cognitive processes. 

They have several characteristics: 
* Bearer (something that represents)
* Referent (the object or idea being represented)
* Content (the information being conveyed)
* Intentionality (the relationship between the content and the referent). 

Mental representations can take various forms, such as imagistic/pictorial representations, symbolic representations, or propositional representations.

## Imagistic/Pictorial Representation:

Imagistic or pictorial representations involve representing objects or ideas by resembling them in some way. They rely on mental imagery and can be broken down into pieces that correspond to real-world elements. 

For example, when you imagine your bedroom, you can mentally visualize the furniture arrangement. Imagistic representations allow us to engage with perceptual information, build mental maps, and manipulate mental images. 

Isomorphism is a concept related to imagistic representation, suggesting a structural similarity between the representation and its referent
